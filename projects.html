    <!-- DIGITAL CAMERA -->
    <div class="section" id="camera">
      <h2><center>Digital Camera</center></h2>
      <p>
        I created my own digital camera using a webcam, battery pack, keypad, and a Raspberry Pi 3B+. I used fswebcam and various libraries to create a script that captures images in multiple modes: retro pixelated, outdoor, and standard. The keypad controls the camera interface, and the webcam flash signals when the photo process is complete. A battery pack powers the entire device, and a systemd service ensures the Python script launches automatically on boot.

    <!-- DOCKETING TOOL -->

      <h2><center>Docketing Tool</center></h2>
      <p>
        During my internship, one of my tasks was to automate the docketing process. Docketing involves documenting time spent on tasks and formatting it into an Excel file. I built a Python tool that integrates Gmail search, keyword filtering, and date ranges. The script parses emails, extracts relevant data, and exports a neatly formatted Excel file. It also includes a standalone .exe version requiring no setup from the end user.

    <!-- HOME SERVER -->
    <div class="section" id="server">
      <h2><center>Home Server</center></h2>
      <p>
        I run a home server on an ACEPC T11 Mini PC with Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS, managed entirely through SSH. Using Docker and Portainer, I set up an ad blocker, VPN, and password manager. I also previously ran a similar setup on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, but later dedicated the Pi to my digital camera project. My next step is creating a local backup system that automatically saves phone photos to an SSD.

    <!-- HANDHELD TETRIS CONSOLE -->
    <div class="section" id="tetris">
      <h2><center>Handheld Tetris Console</center></h2>
      <p>
        I built a Tetris handheld video game console using a series of buttons, a live buzzer, a 0.96 inch OLED screen, and a RP2350 USB-A Microcontroller. I programmed the screen and the game logic along with wiring the whole unit. I plan to use a perf board along with a case that I am yet to salvage to adjust the form factor and increase the portability.

    <!-- AUDIO AMPLIFIER -->
    <div class="section" id="audio-amplifier">
      <h2><center>Audio Amplifier</center></h2>
      <p>
        My best friend had bought a Vinyl Turntable that did not have built in potentiometer and used RCA connections. The speakers they had bought used live wire connections and thus the two were incompatible. The alternative of buying an audio amplifier on amazon was incredibly costly. As such, I used the CD player I previously purchased from a thrift store and salvaged the audio amplification circuit board that contained the TEA2025B IC and reused that. I also salvaged the live wire connectors and several potentiometers from the scrap electronics I've previously gathered. I then soldered some connections with the potentiometers and created a single unit. Thus, it was able to function as an audio amplifier. The board also contained a connector for FM and AM radio and as such it also inherited that capability.
